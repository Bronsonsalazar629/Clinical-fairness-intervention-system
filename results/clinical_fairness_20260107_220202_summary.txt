DEPLOYMENT RECOMMENDATIONS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. PRIORITY: Address baseline bias - A False Negative Rate (FNR) disparity of 1.9% means that Non-White patients
are 1.1x more likely to be incorrectly classified as low-cost,
leading to ...
2. CONDITIONAL: Fairlearn (Demographic Parity) requires monitoring - May not address outcome disparities (only prediction rate equity)
3. RECOMMENDED: Deploy Fairlearn (Equalized Odds) - Constrains model to equalize true positive and false positive rates across demographic groups while ...
4. RECOMMENDED: Deploy AIF360 Reweighing - IBM AIF360 implementation of sample reweighing with comprehensive bias metrics; preserves model inte...


CLINICAL HARM NARRATIVES
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Unmitigated Baseline:
A False Negative Rate (FNR) disparity of 1.9% means that Non-White patients
are 1.1x more likely to be incorrectly classified as low-cost,
leading to inadequate care management and preventable hospitalizations. This
violates the principle of justice (fair resource allocation) by systematically underestimating care
needs for vulnerable populations.

Fairlearn (Demographic Parity):
A False Negative Rate (FNR) disparity of 4.3% means that Non-White patients
are 1.2x more likely to be incorrectly classified as low-cost,
leading to inadequate care management and preventable hospitalizations. This
violates the principle of justice (fair resource allocation) by systematically underestimating care
needs for vulnerable populations.

Fairlearn (Equalized Odds):
A False Negative Rate (FNR) disparity of 1.3% means that Non-White patients
are 1.1x more likely to be incorrectly classified as low-cost,
leading to inadequate care management and preventable hospitalizations. This
violates the principle of justice (fair resource allocation) by systematically underestimating care
needs for vulnerable populations.

AIF360 Reweighing:
A False Negative Rate (FNR) disparity of 1.9% means that Non-White patients
are 1.1x more likely to be incorrectly classified as low-cost,
leading to inadequate care management and preventable hospitalizations. This
violates the principle of justice (fair resource allocation) by systematically underestimating care
needs for vulnerable populations.
